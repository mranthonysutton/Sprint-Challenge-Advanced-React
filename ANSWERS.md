- [x] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

  _We would probably use class components over functional components when we are wanting to utulize the React Life Cycle Methods. Also, class components are best used when we are wanting to implement the use of both state and logic._

- [x] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

  1. Birth/Mounting - Constructor function is called and state data is initialized
  2. Growth/Updating - Any new props will trigger updates to the child and render will be ran again
  3. Death/Unmounting - Cleans up and destroys who was unmounted

- [x] What is the purpose of a custom hook?

  _Custom hooks allows us to re-use our stateful logic and to set state and remember the value that was set._

- [x] Why is it important to test our apps?

  _We test our app so that we can verify that our components are rendering the expected information. Also, we want to make sure that our information is being displayed to the DOM._
